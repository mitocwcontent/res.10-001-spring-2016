Assignment
----------

*   Keep your smartphone camera handy and look for interesting / beautiful / unusual things to photograph over the course of one day. Take pictures at work, home, or while traveling in between. Like the sizzling peppers in Felice's frying pan, look for small, interesting, and beautiful things to capture. While you're at it, take a few pictures of the object you selected for the course. Take as many images as you like but select the best two and comment on them. Be sure to explain what they are and why you chose them. How do these photos help you think about a more controlled, photographic composition you could take with an SLR camera?
*   Pick one of the two images you posted and, using your photo editing software, zoom in on a detail in one of the images and crop to create a new image. Comment on your image.
*   Create a micro-story video (no longer than 1 minute) that represents an event or process. Describe your video's strengths and weaknesses in light of the still photography concepts in the course. If you were to shoot your video over again, what would you do differently?
